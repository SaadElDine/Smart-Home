# Smart-Home
üè° An advanced fully functional Smart Home using **ARDUINO**

- **Access Control:** Our smart door lock ensures only authorized individuals can enter our home, and it's all controlled via a secure keypad system. Plus, it sends instant notifications whenever someone enters or exits.
- **Environmental Comfort:** We've integrated temperature and humidity sensors throughout the house. This not only allows us to monitor and control the indoor climate remotely but also enables automatic adjustments for optimal comfort.
- **Comprehensive Security:** The home security system is state-of-the-art. PIR motion sensors, IR sensors, and smoke detectors work together to detect intruders, fires, and any unusual activity. Real-time alerts are sent to our smartphones for immediate action.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Our lighting system is energy-efficient thanks to LDRs. Lights adjust based on natural light levels, reducing electricity consumption.

- **Pool Maintenance:** With a water level sensor in our pool, we receive real-time notifications when the water level is too high or too low. Keeping our pool in top condition has never been easier.

- **Weather Updates:** The rain sensor doesn't just inform us about rainfall; it also integrates with our climate control system to adjust indoor conditions based on external weather changes.

- **Garage Automation:** Our garage door opens automatically when we arrive home, thanks to an IR sensor. No more fumbling for keys in the rain!

- **Gas Safety:** The gas sensor ensures our safety by detecting any gas leaks in the house. It immediately triggers alarms and shuts off the gas supply in case of a leak.

- **Sound-Activated Lights:** In addition to LDRs, we've installed sound-activated lights in select rooms. Clap your hands, and the lights come on.

- **Voice Control:** With voice assistants integrated, we can control various aspects of our home simply by speaking commands. It's the future of convenience.
